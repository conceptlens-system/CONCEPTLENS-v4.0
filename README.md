## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites

-   **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
-   **Python** (v3.9 or higher)
-   **MongoDB Atlas Account** (for database)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/conceptlens-system/CONCEPTLENS-v2.0.git
cd CONCEPTLENS-v2.0
```

### 2. Backend Setup (FastAPI)

Navigate to the project root (where `main.py` is located).

1.  **Create a Virtual Environment**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    
    # Activate on Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    
    # Activate on Mac/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Run the Backend Server**:
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
    The backend will start at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### 3. Frontend Setup (Next.js)

Open a new terminal and navigate to the `frontend` directory.

1.  **Navigate to Frontend**:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the Frontend Development Server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will start at `http://localhost:3000`.
